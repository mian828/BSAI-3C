       "'WEAK ON CURRENT SCIENCE.\\nAfter seeing it twice, I agree with much (but not all) of the positive five star reviews. Out of respect for those who READ reviews, I\\'ll not repeat everything that I like about the presentation. I found the goofy oversize earrings, hairdo, and facial hair arrangement of Daniel Vitalis, (described as a \"Wild Food Expert\") distracting. UGH. Ditto for David Wolfe, who had an extremely goofy wild hairdo. On the other hand, Jon Gabriel, described as an \"author and weight loss expert\" was nicely groomed and a good presenter. His story of personal transformation of a fellow of over 400 pounds (whew) to becoming a jock of normal weight was inspiring. Christiane Northrup preserves her rank as one of America\\'s cutest doctors. A really nice looking woman! Presentations by Dr. Mercola, Jason Vale, Kris Carr, Alejandro Junger were fine. It was disappointing to have Jamie Oliver (so popular in the UK) give Baby Cow Growth Fluid a pass with unscientific but popular ideas on milk. None of the presenters had anything (ZILCH) to say about the work of Doctor T. Colin Campbell. Milk does a body bad. It was good to see all presenters take a stand against sugar. They all agreed on the evils of sugar and refined carbohydrates. With all respect to Dr. Northrup, her \"It\\'s not fat that makes you fat - it\\'s sugar\" statement will not pass muster in the community of experts. Recognizing the evils of sugar should NOT be mutually exclusive to recognizing the proven dangers of fat - particularly fat from dead animals - and EXTRACTED fat of ALL kinds. Olive Oil is NOT a health food.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-China-Study-The-Most-Comprehensive-Study-of-Nutrition-Ever-Conducted-And-the-Startling-Implications-for-Diet-Weight-Loss-And-Long-term-Health/dp/1932100660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health</a>\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Forks-Over-Knives/dp/B0053ZHZI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Forks Over Knives</a>\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Prevent-and-Reverse-Heart-Disease-The-Revolutionary-Scientifically-Proven-Nutrition-Based-Cure/dp/1583333002/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure</a>\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Plant-Based-Journey-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-for-Transitioning-to-a-Healthy-Lifestyle-and-Achieving-Your-Ideal-Weight/dp/1941631363/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Plant-Based Journey: A Step-by-Step Guide for Transitioning to a Healthy Lifestyle and Achieving Your Ideal Weight</a>'"
